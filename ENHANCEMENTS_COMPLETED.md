### 5. üöß Activity Logs (Not Yet Implemented)

This feature requires database schema changes and is more complex. Here's what it would involve:

**Database Schema Needed:**

```typescript
// Add to schema.ts
export const activityLogs = pgTable("activity_logs", {
  id: uuid("id").defaultRandom().primaryKey(),
  teamId: uuid("team_id")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => teams.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  userId: uuid("user_id")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => users.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  action: varchar("action", { length: 255 }).notNull(), // "member_added", "member_removed", "role_changed", etc.
  targetUserId: uuid("target_user_id").references(() => users.id, { onDelete: "set null" }),
  metadata: json("metadata"), // Additional data about the action
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
});
```

**Would you like me to implement activity logs as well?**

## Testing Checklist

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints check for valid session
2. **Authorization Checks**: Role-based permissions enforced
3. **Owner Protection**: Cannot remove or demote owner
4. **Validation**: Input validated with Zod schemas
5. **Double Confirmation**: Team deletion requires name confirmation
6. **Cascade Deletion**: Removing team deletes all members and invitations

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you'd like to add Activity Logs, I can implement:

1. **Database Schema**: Activity logs table with actions, timestamps, and metadata
2. **API Endpoints**: Record activities automatically on all team actions
3. **Activity Feed**: UI component showing recent team activities
4. **Filters**: Filter by action type, date range, or user
5. **Export**: Download activity logs as CSV

Would you like me to implement the Activity Logs feature?

## Performance Considerations

- All operations include proper indexes on foreign keys
- Cascade deletes configured for data integrity
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Minimal API calls with strategic data fetching

## Build Status

‚úÖ TypeScript compilation: Passing
‚úÖ All routes: Functional
‚úÖ All components: Rendering correctly

Your enhanced team management system is ready to use!
