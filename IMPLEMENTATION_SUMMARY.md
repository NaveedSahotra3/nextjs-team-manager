# Implementation Summary: AI Headshots & Credits System

## What Was Built

A complete **AI headshot generation system with Stripe-based credit management**, inspired by [Aragon.ai](https://www.aragon.ai/).

## Key Components

### 1. Database Schema (`src/db/schema.ts`)

âœ… Added 4 new tables:

- **teamCredits** - Team-level credit pool
- **memberCredits** - Per-member credit allocation
- **headshots** - Generation tracking
- **payments** - Payment history

### 2. Credit Management (`src/lib/credits.ts`)

âœ… Helper functions for:

- Initialize team credits
- Add credits after purchase
- Allocate to members
- Auto-distribute
- Deduct on generation
- Get balances & overview
- Reassign between members

### 3. Stripe Integration (`src/lib/stripe.ts`)

âœ… Configuration for:

- Credit packages (Starter, Pro, Enterprise, Custom)
- Price calculation
- Stripe client setup

### 4. API Routes

**Stripe:**

- `POST /api/stripe/create-checkout` - Checkout session
- `POST /api/stripe/webhook` - Handle payment events

**Credits:**

- `GET /api/teams/[id]/credits/overview`
- `POST /api/teams/[id]/credits/allocate`
- `POST /api/teams/[id]/credits/auto-distribute`
- `POST /api/teams/[id]/credits/reassign`

**Headshots:**

- `POST /api/teams/[id]/headshots/generate`
- `GET /api/teams/[id]/headshots`
- `GET /api/teams/[id]/headshots/[id]`
- `PATCH /api/teams/[id]/headshots/[id]`
- `DELETE /api/teams/[id]/headshots/[id]`

### 5. User Interfaces

**Admin Dashboard** - `/teams/[slug]/credits`

- View credit overview
- Purchase credits (Stripe checkout)
- Allocate to members
- Auto-distribute
- Monitor usage

**Member Dashboard** - `/teams/[slug]/headshots`

- View credit balance
- Generate headshots
- Track status
- Download results

## How It Works

### Purchase Flow

```
Admin â†’ Credits page â†’ Select package â†’ Stripe checkout
â†’ Payment â†’ Webhook â†’ Credits added â†’ Allocate to members
```

### Generation Flow

```
Member â†’ Headshots page â†’ Upload photos â†’ Select style
â†’ Generate â†’ Credits deducted â†’ Processing â†’ Complete â†’ Download
```

## Credit System

| Package      | Credits  | Price    | Per Credit |
| ------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Starter      | 50       | $29      | $0.58      |
| Professional | 150      | $79      | $0.53      |
| Enterprise   | 500      | $199     | $0.40      |
| Custom       | Variable | $0.50/ea | $0.50      |

## What's Next (Integration Required)

### 1. AI Service Integration

The headshot generation API is ready but needs AI service integration:

- **Replicate** - `npm install replicate`
- **Stability AI** - REST API
- **Custom service** - Your own model

Location: `src/app/api/teams/[teamId]/headshots/generate/route.ts`

### 2. File Storage

Image uploads need cloud storage:

- **AWS S3** - `@aws-sdk/client-s3`
- **Cloudinary** - `cloudinary`
- **Vercel Blob** - `@vercel/blob`

### 3. Email Notifications (Optional)

Notify members when headshots complete.
